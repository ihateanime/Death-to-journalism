Firstly op art is almost always done with a computer or other machine, and not human hands.
Therefore, I cannot truly call it art, just an optical illusion.

The idea of op art is unacceptable to me.
Abstract art is little more than an exercise in laziness and a bid for quick fame.

Getulio Alviani is a bit better because he does his works by hand,but I still cannot say that he is remarkable in any way. He mostly does metal etchings which I have difficulty seeing as op art, since thy are not optical illusions.
Getulio Alviani (5 September 1939 in Udine â€“ 24 February 2018 in Milan)[1] was an Italian painter based in Milan. He is considered to be an important International Optical - kinetic artist.

Richard Anuszkiewicz, born May 23, 1930 is an American painter, printmaker, and sculptor.
He at least knows about color theory, though my resoect for op art remains unchanged.

Carlos Cruz-Diez (born August 17, 1923 in Caracas) is a Venezuelan op artist.
his art does not very much appear to be 'optical' at all- it seems more correct tocall him a simple abstract artist, but he is known for op art.
